# GSAP in Your React Portfolio: The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide

## 1. What is GSAP and Why Use It?

**GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** is a powerful JavaScript library for building high-performance, professional-grade animations. It works with vanilla JS, React, and many other frameworks. GSAP is used by top companies for its:
- Smooth, hardware-accelerated animations
- Fine control over timing, sequencing, and triggers
- Plugins for scroll, SVG, text, and more
- Excellent performance and browser compatibility

**Why use GSAP in your React portfolio?**
- Stand out with stunning, interactive animations
- Animate on scroll, hover, or page load
- Easily sequence complex animations
- Go beyond what CSS can do

## 2. Installing and Setting Up GSAP in React

**Step 1: Install GSAP**
```bash
npm install gsap
# or
yarn add gsap
```

**Step 2: (Optional) Install Plugins**
For scroll-based animations:
```bash
npm install gsap@npm:@gsap/scrolltrigger
```

**Step 3: Import GSAP in Your Component**
```js
import gsap from 'gsap';
// For ScrollTrigger:
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger';
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
```

---

## 3. Animating Elements: The Basics

**GSAP uses the `gsap.to`, `gsap.from`, and `gsap.fromTo` methods:**
```js
// Animate to a state
gsap.to('.my-element', { x: 100, opacity: 1, duration: 1 });
// Animate from a state
gsap.from('.my-element', { y: 50, opacity: 0, duration: 1 });
// Animate from one state to another
gsap.fromTo('.my-element', { scale: 0 }, { scale: 1, duration: 1 });
```

**You can target elements by class, id, or ref.**

---

## 4. Using GSAP with React Hooks and Refs

**Why?** React manages the DOM, so you should use refs to target elements for animation.

**Step 1: Create a ref**
```js
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
const myRef = useRef();
```

**Step 2: Animate in useEffect**
```js
useEffect(() => {
  gsap.from(myRef.current, { y: 50, opacity: 0, duration: 1 });
}, []);
```

**Step 3: Attach the ref**
```jsx
<div ref={myRef}>Animate me!</div>
```

**For multiple elements:**
- Use `gsap.utils.toArray('.className')` or map refs in an array.

## 5. ScrollTrigger: Animating on Scroll

**Step 1: Register the plugin**
```js
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger';
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
```

**Step 2: Add a scroll animation**
```js
useEffect(() => {
  gsap.from('.project-card', {
    scrollTrigger: {
      trigger: '.project-card',
      start: 'top 80%',
      end: 'bottom 20%',
      toggleActions: 'play none none reverse',
    },
    y: 100,
    opacity: 0,
    duration: 0.8,
    stagger: 0.2,
  });
}, []);
```

**You can use refs or class selectors.**

---

## 6. Structuring Animation Code for Maintainability

- **Keep animation logic close to the component it animates.**
- **Use descriptive classNames or refs.**
- **Encapsulate repeated animation logic in custom hooks (e.g., useGsapFadeIn).**
- **Clean up animations in useEffect (return a cleanup function if needed).**
- **Comment your animation code for clarity.**

---

## 7. Debugging and Optimizing GSAP Animations

- Use the GSAP [dev tools](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Tools/GSDevTools) for timeline debugging.
- Use Chrome DevTools to inspect animated elements.
- Use `will-change: transform` in CSS for smoother animations.
- Avoid animating layout properties (width, height, top, left) if possible; prefer `transform` and `opacity`.
- Test on multiple devices and browsers.

---

## 8. Accessibility and Reduced Motion

- Respect user preferences for reduced motion:
```js
const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches;
if (prefersReducedMotion) return; // Skip or simplify animations
```
- Keep animations short and non-distracting.
- Avoid flashing or rapidly moving elements.

---

## 9. Example Use Cases for Each Main Page

### Hero.jsx
- Animate name and role on mount (fade/slide in)
- Stagger in CTA buttons
- Animate background or floating icons

### Skills.jsx
- Stagger in skill cards on mount
- Animate highlights or icons on hover
- Animate expertise area cards on scroll (ScrollTrigger)

### Projects.jsx
- Animate project cards as they enter the viewport (ScrollTrigger)
- Animate filter buttons on click

### Contact.jsx
- Animate form fields on mount
- Animate success message on submit
