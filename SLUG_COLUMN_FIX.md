# URL Slug Column Fix

## Issue
The CMS blog form shows "Unable to validate slug uniqueness" because the `blogs` table is missing the `slug` column.

## Current Table Structure
The `blogs` table currently has:
- id (uuid)
- title (text)
- content (text) 
- thumbnail (text)
- video_url (text)
- created_at (timestamp)
- views (integer)
- tags (text[])
- type (text)

**Missing: `slug` column**

## Solutions

### Option 1: Add Slug Column (Recommended)
Run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the script from `database_migrations/add_slug_column.sql`

This will:
- Add the `slug` column to the blogs table
- Create a unique index for performance
- Generate slugs for existing blog posts
- Handle duplicate slugs automatically
- Add validation constraints

### Option 2: Use ID-Based URLs (Current Temporary Fix)
The code has been modified to gracefully handle the missing slug column:
- Slug validation errors are ignored
- Blog URLs will use IDs instead of slugs
- Form submission is not blocked

## URL Structure

### With Slug Column (After Migration)
```
/blog/learning-about-cms
/blog/react-best-practices
/blog/javascript-tips-and-tricks
```

### Without Slug Column (Current)
```
/blog/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
/blog/987fcdeb-51a2-43d1-9f12-123456789abc
```

## Testing the Fix

After running the migration:
1. Create a new blog post
2. The slug should auto-generate from the title
3. You can customize the slug manually
4. Duplicate slugs will be automatically numbered (e.g., `my-post-1`, `my-post-2`)

## Code Changes Made

1. **BlogForm.jsx**: Modified slug validation to not block form submission
2. **blogService.js**: Added error handling for missing slug column
3. **Graceful degradation**: System works with or without slug column

## Verification

To verify the slug column exists:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'blogs' AND table_schema = 'public';
```

You should see `slug | text` in the results after running the migration.
