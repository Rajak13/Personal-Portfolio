🛠️ Tech Stack
GSAP (gsap & ScrollTrigger)

🧩 Core Requirements
📌 Entry Animations
Animate hero section (fade-in + slide-up for name/tagline).

Sequential entrance of skills or tech stack using staggered animation.

📌 Scroll-based Animations
Use ScrollTrigger to animate project cards as they enter the viewport.

Add subtle parallax or scale-in effects to images or sections.

📌 Page Transitions (Optional if using React Router)
Smooth fade/slide when switching between routes.

📌 Interactivity Enhancements
Hover animations on buttons or project cards (e.g., grow/shrink, color pulse).

Animate form submission with a success bounce or fade.

📌 Responsive Behavior
Ensure animations work fluidly across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Bonus (if time allows)
Add GSAP timeline sequences for chained animations.

Combine with react-intersection-observer for cleaner triggers.
